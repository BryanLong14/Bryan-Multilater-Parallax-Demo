## What is it?

This code adds basic parallax to a site. Specifically, it slides a colored overlay on top of two static background images which change as the user scrolls.

The key to understanding multilayer parallax using pure CSS involves understanding transforming the browser into a virtual 3D environment.
This allows you to make different layers, which when the user scrolls, move at different speeds.
